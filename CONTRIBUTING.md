# 🌊 BΞYTΞFLʘW | Contribution Protocol v1.0
</p>

First, thank you for intercepting our stream. We welcome contributors who are passionate about high-performance web architecture and futuristic design.

By contributing to BeyteFlow, you help us refine the flow of data across the modern web.

---

## 🛠️ The Developer Environment

To ensure a seamless sync with our core systems, please follow these environmental requirements:

* **Node.js:** `v20.x` or higher (LTS recommended)
* **Package Manager:** `pnpm` (preferred) or `npm`
* **Editor:** VS Code (recommended with ESLint & Prettier extensions)

---

## 🛰️ Branching & Deployment Strategy

We follow a strict **Feature-Branch** workflow to keep our `main` branch production-ready at all times.

1. **Synchronize:** Ensure your local `main` is up to date.
2. **Branch:** Create a descriptively named branch:
   - `feat/feature-name` (New functionality)
   - `fix/glitch-name` (Bug fixes)
   - `docs/update-manual` (Documentation)
   - `perf/optimization` (Performance tuning)
3. **Commit:** Use [Atomic Commits](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).

---

## 📜 Commit Message Standards

We use the **Conventional Commits** specification. This allows us to auto-generate changelogs and manage versioning.

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

- **feat:** A new "byte" of functionality.
- **fix:** Patching a leak in the flow.
- **refactor:** Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- **chore:** Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

*Example:* `feat(ui): add neon-glow animation to navbar buttons`

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance (QA)

Before submitting a Pull Request (PR), initiate the following diagnostics:

- [ ] **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` to ensure code style compliance.
- [ ] **Build:** Run `npm run build` to confirm the production bundle is stable.
- [ ] **Tests:** Run `npm run test` (if applicable) to ensure no regressions.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Update READMEs if your changes introduce new logic.

---

## 🚀 Pull Request Protocol

When your code is ready for the stream:
1. Open a PR against the `main` branch.
2. Link the PR to a specific issue (e.g., `Closes #42`).
3. Provide a video/GIF for any UI/UX changes.
4. Wait for a **Core Maintainer** to review and approve your bytes.

## 📡 Communication & Support

- **Discord:** Join our [Dev-Terminal](#) for real-time collaboration.
- **GitHub Discussions:** For architectural proposals and brainstorming.
- **Security:** If you find a vulnerability, please email `security@beyteflow.dev` instead of opening a public issue.
